# learning-numerical-methods

This is a repository I will be using for learning how to implement various numerical schemes using C, C++, and Fortran.

The algorithms implemented will be the numerical integration schemes discussed in Chapter 8 of Differential Equations by Boyce and Diprima, including

- euler
- backward euler
- improved euler
- RK4
- RK6
- Adams-bashforth
- Adams-moulton
- predictor-corrector
